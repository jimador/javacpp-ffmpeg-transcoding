# Transcoding Tester

The aim of this project is to provide myself with a playground to test out [JavaCPP] as an
an easy to use Java interface to [FFmpeg]. All of the JNI classes are automatically generated
with [JavaCPP]. Even the compilation into native code is controlled by JavaCPP. This way there is less effort to react
to new FFmpeg updates.
